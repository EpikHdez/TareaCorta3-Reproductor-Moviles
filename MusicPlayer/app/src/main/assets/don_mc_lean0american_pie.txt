[00:01]A long long time ago
[00:03]I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
[00:12]And I knew if I had my chance
[00:15]That I could make those people dance
[00:19]And maybe they'd be happy for a while.
[00:25]But february made me shiver
[00:29]With every paper I'd deliver
[00:33]Bad news on the doorstep
[00:36]I couldn't take one more step
[00:40]I can't remember if I cried
[00:43]When I read about his widowed bride
[00:48]But something touched me deep inside
[00:53]The day the music died
[01:03]So bye-bye, miss american pie
[01:07]Drove my chevy to the levee
[01:09]But the levee was dry
[01:12]And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[01:17]Singin' this'll be the day that I die
[01:23]This'll be the day that I die
[01:29]Did you write the book of love
[01:31]And do you have faith in god above
[01:35]If the bible tells you so
[01:40]Do you believe in rock 'n roll
[01:43]Can music save your mortal soul
[01:47]And can you teach me how to dance real slow
[01:53]Well, I know that you're in love with him
[01:57]'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
[02:01]You both kicked off your shoes
[02:03]Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
[02:08]I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
[02:11]With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
[02:14]But I knew I was out of luck
[02:17]The day the music died
[02:24]I started singin'
[02:25]Bye-bye, miss american pie
[02:28]Drove my chevy to the levee
[02:30]But the levee was dry
[02:32]And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[02:35]Singin' this'll be the day that I die
[02:39]This'll be the day that I die?
[02:43]Now for ten years we've been on our own
[02:47]And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
[02:51]But that's not how it used to be
[02:56]When the jester sang for the king and queen
[02:59]In a coat he borrowed from james dean
[03:03]And a voice that came from you and me
[03:10]Oh, and while the king was looking down
[03:14]The jester stole his thorny crown
[03:17]The courtroom was adjourned
[03:20]No verdict was returned
[03:24]And while lennon read a book of marx
[03:28]The quartet practiced in the park
[03:31]And we sang dirges in the dark
[03:34]The day the music died
[03:40]We were singing
[03:41]Bye-bye, miss american pie
[03:44]Drove my chevy to the levee
[03:47]But the levee was dry
[03:49]And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[03:52]Singin' this'll be the day that I die
[03:56]This'll be the day that I die
[04:01]Helter skelter in a summer swelter
[04:04]The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
[04:09]Eight miles high and falling fast
[04:14]It landed foul out on the grass
[04:17]The players tried for a forward pass
[04:20]With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
[04:26]Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
[04:30]While the sergeants played a marching tune
[04:34]We all got up to dance
[04:37]Oh, but we never got the chance
[04:40]'Cause the players tried to take the field
[04:44]The marching band refused to yield
[04:48]Do you recall what was revealed
[04:51]The day the music died
[04:57]We started singing
[04:58]Bye-bye, miss american pie
[05:01]Drove my chevy to the levee
[05:03]But the levee was dry
[05:05]And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[05:08]Singin' this'll be the day that I die
[05:13]This'll be the day that I die
[05:17]Oh, and there we were all in one place
[05:21]A generation lost in space
[05:24]With no time left to start again
[05:29]So come on, jack be nimble, jack be quick
[05:34]Jack flash sat on a candlestick
[05:36]'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
[05:43]Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
[05:47]My hands were clenched in fists of rage
[05:51]No angel born in hell
[05:54]Could break that satan's spell
[05:56]And as the flames climbed high into the night
[06:02]To light the sacrifical rite
[06:05]I saw satan laughing with delight
[06:08]The day the music died
[06:15]He was singing
[06:16]Bye-bye, miss american pie
[06:19]Drove my chevy to the levee
[06:21]But the levee was dry
[06:23]And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[06:26]Singin' this'll be the day that I die
[06:30]This'll be the day that I die
[06:36]I met a girl who sang the blues
[06:40]And I asked her for some happy news
[06:44]But she just smiled and turned away
[06:49]I went down to the sacred store
[06:51]Where I'd heard the music years before
[06:55]But the man there said the music wouldn't play
[07:03]And in the streets the children screamed
[07:07]The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
[07:10]But not a word was spoken
[07:15]The church bells all were broken
[07:19]And the three men I admire most
[07:23]The father, son and the holy ghost
[07:27]They caught the last train for the coast
[07:31]The day the music died
[07:39]And they were singing
[07:41]Bye-bye, miss american pie
[07:46]Drove my chevy to the levee
[07:49]But the levee was dry
