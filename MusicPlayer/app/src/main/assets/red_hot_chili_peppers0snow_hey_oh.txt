[00:19]Come to decide that the things that I tried
[00:21]Were in my life just to get high on
[00:24]When I sit alone
[00:25]Come get a little known
[00:26]But I need more than myself this time
[00:28]Step from the road to the sea to the sky
[00:30]And I do believe that we rely on
[00:33]When I lay it on
[00:34]Come get to play it on
[00:35]All my life to sacrifice
[00:37]Hey oh
[00:40]Listen what I say, oh
[00:46]I got your hey oh
[00:49]Now listen what I say, oh
[00:56]When will I know that I really can't go
[00:58]To the well once more time to decide on?
[01:01]When it's killing me
[01:02]When will I really see
[01:03]All that I need to look inside
[01:05]Come to believe that I better not leave
[01:07]Before I get my chance to ride
[01:10]When it's killing me
[01:11]What do I really need
[01:12]All that I need to look inside
[01:14]Hey oh
[01:17]Listen what I say, oh
[01:23]Come back and hey oh
[01:26]Look here what I say oh
[01:32]The more I see, the less I know
[01:35]The more I like to let it go
[01:37]Hey oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
[01:47]Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
[01:51]Where it's so white as snow
[01:56]Privately divided by a world so undecided
[02:00]And there's nowhere to go
[02:05]In between the cover of another perfect wonder
[02:09]And it's so white as snow
[02:14]Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
[02:18]And there's nowhere to go
[02:32]When to descend to amend for a friend
[02:34]All the channels that have broken down
[02:37]Now you bring it up
[02:38]I'm gonna ring it up
[02:39]Just to hear you sing it out
[02:41]Step from the road to the sea to the sky
[02:43]And I do believe what we rely on
[02:46]When I lay it on
[02:47]Come get to play it on
[02:48]All my life to sacrifice
[02:49]Hey oh
[02:53]Listen what I say, oh
[02:59]I got your hey oh
[03:02]Listen what I say, oh
[03:09]The more I see, the less I know
[03:11]The more I like to let it go
[03:14]Hey oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
[03:23]Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
[03:27]Where it's so white as snow
[03:32]Privately divided by a world so undecided
[03:36]And there's nowhere to go
[03:41]In between the cover of another perfect wonder
[03:45]Where it's so white as snow
[03:50]Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
[03:54]And there's nowhere to go
[03:58]I said hey, hey, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, tell my love now
[04:08]Hey, hey, yeah, oh yeah, tell my love now
[04:16]Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
[04:20]Where it's so white as snow
[04:25]Privately divided by a world so undecided
[04:29]And there's nowhere to go
[04:34]Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
[04:38]Where it's so white as snow
[04:43]Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
[04:47]And there's nowhere to go
[04:51]I said hey oh yeah, oh yeah
[04:58]Tell my love now
[05:01]Hey, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
