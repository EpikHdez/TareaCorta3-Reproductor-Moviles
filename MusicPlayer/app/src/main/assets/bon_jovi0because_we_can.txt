[00:00]I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
[00:06]I am a rock, not just another grain of sand that's right
[00:11]I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
[00:15]I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand because we can
[00:21]<Music>
[00:29]She's in the kitchen starin' out the window
[00:34]So tired of livin' life in black and white
[00:38]Right now she's missin' those technicolour kisses
[00:42]When he turns down the lights
[00:46]But lately feelin' like a broken promise
[00:52]In the mirror starin' down his doubt
[00:56]There's only one thing in this world that he'd know
[01:01]He said forever and he'll never let her down
[01:04]I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
[01:09]I am a rock, not just another grain of sand that's right
[01:14]I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
[01:18]I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand because we can
[01:19]<Music>
[01:26]Eatin' takeout on a coffee table
[01:31]Paper dishes, pour a glass of wine
[01:35]Turn down the sound and move a little closer
[01:39]And for the moment everything is alright
[01:44]I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
[01:48]I am a rock, not just another grain of sand that's right
[01:53]I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
[01:57]I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
[02:00]Because we can, our love can move a mountain
[02:06]We can, if you believe in we
[02:11]We can, just wrap your arms around me
[02:14]We can, we can
[02:16]<Music>
[02:39]I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean I don't wanna be
[02:44]I am a rock, not just another grain of sand that's right
[02:48]Wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
[02:53]I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
[02:57]I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
[03:01]I am a rock, not just another grain of sand that's right
[03:06]I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
[03:10]I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
[03:14]Because we can because we can
[03:16]Our love can move a mountain
[03:18]We can, if you believe in we
[03:23]We can, just wrap your arms around me
[03:28]We can, we can
[03:32]Because we can
[03:34]<Music>
