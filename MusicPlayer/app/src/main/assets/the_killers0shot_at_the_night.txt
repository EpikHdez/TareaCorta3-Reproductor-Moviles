[00:21]Once in a lifetime, the suffering of fools
[00:32]To find our way home, to break in these palms
[00:41]Once in a lifetime (Once in a lifetime)
[00:46]Once in a lifetime
[00:51]Give me a shot at the night
[00:57]Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
[01:02]Give me a shot at the night
[01:07]Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
[01:15]Once in a lifetime, the breaking of the roof
[01:26]To find that our home, has long been out grown
[01:35]Draw me a life line, 'cause honey I got nothing to lose
[01:46]Once in a lifetime (Once in a lifetime)
[01:51]Once in a lifetime
[01:56]Give me a shot at the night
[02:01]Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
[02:06]Give me a shot at the night
[02:11]Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
[02:17]Give me a shot at the night
[02:35]Look at my reflection in the mirror
[02:40]Underneath the power of the light
[02:46]Give me a shot at the night
[02:50]Give me a shot at the night
[02:55]Give me a shot at the night
[02:59]I feel like I'm losing the fight
[03:01]Give me a shot at the night
[03:04]Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
[03:06]Give me a shot at the night
[03:16]Give me a shot at the night
[03:21]Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
[03:26]Give me a shot at the night
[03:32]Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
[03:37]Give me a shot at the night
[03:42]Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
[03:47]Give me a shot at the night
