[00:21]I'm tired of being what you want me to be
[00:25]Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
[00:30]Don't know what you're expecting of me
[00:34]Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
[00:39]Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
[00:43]Every step I take is another mistake to you
[00:48]Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
[00:52]I've become so numb I can't feel you there
[00:57]I've become so tired so much more aware
[01:01]I've becoming this all I want to do
[01:05]Is be more like me and be less like you
[01:10]Can't you see that you're smothering me
[01:14]Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
[01:18]Cause everything that you thought I would be
[01:21]Has fallen apart right in front of you
[01:27]Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
[01:31]Every step that I take is another mistake to you
[01:35]Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
[01:39]And every second I waste is more than I can take
[01:44]I've become so numb I can't feel you there
[01:49]I've become so tired so much more aware
[01:54]I've becoming this all I want to do
[01:57]Is be more like me and be less like you
[02:02]And I know
[02:05]I may end up failing too
[02:12]But I know
[02:14]You were just like me with someone disappointed in you
[02:21]I've become so numb I can't feel you there
[02:26]I've become so tired so much more aware
[02:31]I've becoming this all I want to do
[02:35]Is be more like me and be less like you
[02:39]I've become so numb I can't feel you there
[02:43]Is everything what you want me to be
[02:47]I've become so numb I can't feel you there
[02:52]Is everything what you want me to be?
